# config
This repository sets up my peronal configuration for my Ubuntu machines. Anyone is free to see and use anything written here.

I divided the repo into two parts. The first part installs the software I want. It's meant to be run on a freashly installed Ubuntu machine. The second part creates soft symlinks to my configuration files. This allows me to update my config files with a simple git pull.
